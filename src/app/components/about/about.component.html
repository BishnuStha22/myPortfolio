      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I am Bishnu Shrestha. I am originally from the western part of Nepal
        and am currently paving my future with a passion for learning, creating, and moving forward.
        I've always been interested in technology and programming,
        enjoying how things work and solving real-world problems through code.
      </p>
      <p>
        To follow that passion and convert it into reality,
        I am enrolled at St. Clair College in the Computer Programming program.
        My curiosity about how things work behind the scenes in the digital world has pushed me
        to explore programming as a career path.
